# ‚úàÔ∏è Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
### Data Science & Data Analyst Bootcamp  
Module: *Exploring Clustering Techniques with Python*

## üéØ Project Overview
This project is part of the **Unsupervised Learning module**, focusing on **customer segmentation** using **K-Means Clustering**.  
 was tasked to group customers based on their flight behaviors to help the business identify marketing strategies and retention programs for each segment.

## üß† Objectives
- Perform **data preprocessing** and cleaning using Python.
- Conduct **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand customer patterns.
- Build and optimize a **K-Means clustering model** to group customers.
- **Visualize clusters** with meaningful charts for interpretation.
- Evaluate clustering performance using **Silhouette Score**.
- Provide **business insights and recommendations** for each cluster.

| `FFP_TIER` | Membership tier |
| `WORK_CITY`, `WORK_PROVINCE`, `WORK_COUNTRY` | Location data |
| `AGE` | Age of the customer |
| `FLIGHT_COUNT` | Number of flights taken |
| `BP_SUM` | Total booking plans made |
| `SUM_YR_1`, `SUM_YR_2` | Total points/credits in year 1 and 2 |
| `SEG_KM_SUM` | Total flight distance (km) |
| `LAST_FLIGHT_DATE` | Most recent flight date |
| `LAST_TO_END`, `AVG_INTERVAL`, `MAX_INTERVAL` | Flight activity intervals |
| `EXCHANGE_COUNT` | Number of point redemptions |
| `avg_discount` | Average discount received |
| `Points_Sum`, `Point_NotFlight` | Points earned and not used from flights |
